<p>This is one of my favorite dishes to make when I'm craving comfort food. I make a large batch because I'm a huge fan of leftovers to avoid cooking every day.</p>

<p>Note: Unless I specify whole packages/containers of the ingredients, I estimate measurements because I'm lazy and don't use measuring cups (I also don't have a dishwasher). I taste and see what it needs, so these measurements are meant to be a guide (I'm sorry if this offends anyone who likes to be more precise). Maybe this is why I don't do much baking. Feel free to adjust amounts to your liking.</p>
<h2>Recipe</h2>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound of fettuccine noodles</li>
    <li>1 pint heavy cream</li> 
    <li>1 stick butter</li>
    <li>1-2 pounds of cooked chicken breasts, cut into strips</li>
    <li>5-6 cloves garlic (minced or squeeze-pressed)</li>
    <li>3/4 cup parmesan</li>
    <li>1/4 cup white cooking wine</li>
    <li>1-2 Tbs corn starch or flour (to thicken)</li>
    <li>1 Tbs oregano</li>
    <li>1 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
    <li>salt and cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>For tender chicken, I loosely follow <a href="https://domesticate-me.com/idiotproof-chicken-breasts/">this method.</a> Note: I cut my chicken breasts in half first so they cook faster. After they're cooked through, just cut them into strips, as shown in the ingredient picture.</li>
    <li>Bring water to a boil in a large pot for the noodles.</li>
    <li>For the sauce, melt your butter in a separate large saucepan. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add cornstarch, incorporate quickly. Add cooking wine and chicken breasts, allow to simmer for a couple minutes. Add heavy cream, parmesan, and spices.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
